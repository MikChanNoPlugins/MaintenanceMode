# MikChan„ÅÆ MaintenanceMode

This plugin adds a very easy to use maintenance mode to your server. In case your production server is up, and yet you still need to do something before letting players in.

Supports PlaceholderAPI.

## Usage

First of all, you need to give the permission `mcn.maintenance.allow` to everyone who has to have access during the maintenance period, and then just write `/maintenance enable`. It will kick all other players, and not let them in till the maintenance period is over. You can disable the maintenance mode by writing `/maintenance disable`. You can also change the kick message and customize MOTD during the maintenance period by editing `config.yml`. For changes to take effect you either need to run `/maintenance reload` or restart the server.

## Supported Versions

Spigot/Paper/Bukkit 1.16.5+
